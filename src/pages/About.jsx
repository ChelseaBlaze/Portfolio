                Hi! My name is Chelsea. I am a UX designer and Frontend
                Developer who has a hard time picking sides.
              </p>

              <p>
                A recent graduate of Hyper Island's frontend developer program,
                I also worked on projects with a focus in UX and UI Design and I
                am happiest when I get the chance to combine those areas with
                coding.
              </p>

              <p>
                Research-ninja, eternal-optimist, and team-moderator are
                particular labels that I have earned over the years through my
                experiences working within education and the sciences. Design
                and understanding people have always been at the core of what I
                do, regardless of my profession.
              </p>

              <p>
                I am a social, positive, and curious person who tends to go the
                extra mile for the people in my life and for the work that I do.
                I thrive on new experiences and rarely say no when interesting
                opportunities come my way.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                The film on this page was one of them. I guarantee that I am
                much friendlier IRL ðŸ˜Š{" "}
